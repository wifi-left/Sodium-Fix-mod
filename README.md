# Introduction
## Mod Name
Sodium Fix Mod
## Description
This mod simply addresses the issue in Sodium Issue #1016 (https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/issues/1016). This mod converts that issue into log output, not a crash.
The mod is in an experimental state, and no problems have been found so far. If you find a problem, please report it in an issue [here](https://github.com/wifi-left/Sodium-Fix-mod/issues).
I don't know if this mixin works or if it conflicts with other mods. Hope this mod can help you.
## Requirement
Fabric 1.19(.1)
Sodium 0.4.2 (The version I'm using)
